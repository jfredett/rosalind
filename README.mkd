# Rosalind Problems in Rust

Fun times with Bioinformatics.

## Rough design so far

Nucleotides are encoded as 2-bit strings and packed into an automatically
expanding vector of u64s. They're set up so that bitwise NOT is equivalent to
Nucleotide Complement. Solutions will each have a binary in src/bin, and the
rest of the code will be a library at some point.

Mostly this is for fun, so `\_('.')_/`
